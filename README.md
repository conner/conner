Hi! I've spent the last 15 years working as a software engineer (full-stack, primarily backend) and technical lead on projects of all sizes.

After a career break as a full-time dad I'm starting to look for work again. Reach out to me at `me at connerpeirce dot com` or linkedin if you you're looking for collaborators.
